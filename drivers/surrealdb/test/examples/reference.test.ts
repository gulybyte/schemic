/**
 * Verifies the @schemic/surrealdb REFERENCE example cookbook (`examples/*`): every catalog entry must
 * emit EXACTLY its documented `ddl`. Each entry's `defs` are DERIVED from its `code` snippet (see
 * `examples/_kit.ts#ex`), so `expect(emit(defs)).toBe(ddl)` is exactly `emit(eval(code)) === ddl` — the
 * strongest honesty check: `code`, `defs`, and `ddl` cannot disagree. Change the emitter and this fails
 * until the reference is updated, so the docs can never lie about the DDL.
 *
 * Pure emit (no live database). Round-trip fidelity (apply -> introspect -> diff = 0, and `pull`
 * regeneration) is covered by the live parity suites under `test/parity/*` against SurrealDB 3.1.3.
